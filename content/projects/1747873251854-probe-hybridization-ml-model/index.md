This project addressed the challenge of high failure rates and costs associated with the experimental validation of SSO probes. I developed and trained a supervised machine learning model by leveraging a large dataset of historical Quality Control (QC) records. The model was trained to identify complex patterns within a probe's DNA sequence that correlate to its real-world hybridization performance. As a result, this predictive tool can now accurately score new probe designs in silico, enabling the pre-emptive filtering of poor candidates and streamlining the development of more reliable and cost-effective diagnostic kits.
