The process of designing a new HLA diagnostic kit is extremely time consuming and usually takes a team of scientists months to develop and test. In the field of HLA, new alleles of the HLA gene are discovered every day with the number of alleles growing exponentially. Because of this, typing kits must be able to detect and resolve new alleles, which requires frequent redesigns. The program I developed at Thermo Fisher Scientific is designed to replace the time-consuming process of manually redesigning a kit. The algorithm uses optimization and principles in information theory to generate more efficient kits than those manually designed by experts, resulting in massive cost savings in raw materials and wages. It also incorporates a machine learning model trained on QC data from previously designed probes to predict hybridization performance of new, untested probes.
