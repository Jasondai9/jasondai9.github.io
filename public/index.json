As a developer passionate about leveraging data for intelligent decision-making, I embarked on a personal project to build an AI-driven algorithmic trading system. This endeavor wasn\u0026rsquo;t just about exploring financial markets; it was a deep dive into complex system design, high-frequency data processing, and the practical application of machine learning.\nThe Challenge: Harnessing Volatility with Precision #\rThe financial markets are a dynamic, ever-changing environment. Manual trading, while offering direct control, often struggles with the speed and sheer volume of data required for optimal decision-making. My goal was to create a system that could identify and act on opportunities with a level of speed and analytical rigor that human traders simply cannot match.\nMy Approach: A Data-Driven, Automated Solution #\rAt the heart of this project lies an AI designed to analyze real-time market data and execute trades autonomously. Here\u0026rsquo;s a high-level overview of its core components:\nHigh-Resolution Data Analysis: The system operates on a 1-minute data scale, processing granular price movements to capture short-term trends and volatility. This requires robust data ingestion and processing capabilities. Intelligent Feature Engineering: Beyond raw price data, the AI incorporates a comprehensive set of inputs. This includes the stock\u0026rsquo;s current and historical normalized price, which helps the model understand relative value irrespective of absolute price levels, as well as a variety of technical indicators. These indicators are carefully selected and processed to provide meaningful insights into market momentum, volume, and potential reversal points. Profitability Scoring \u0026amp; Decision Making: The AI\u0026rsquo;s core function is to assign a \u0026ldquo;profitability score\u0026rdquo; to potential trade opportunities. This score is generated by sophisticated machine learning models that have learned from historical data, identifying patterns indicative of favorable outcomes. Automated Execution with Risk Management: If a trade\u0026rsquo;s profitability score meets a pre-defined threshold, the system doesn\u0026rsquo;t just suggest a trade â€“ it automatically places it. Crucially, every trade is executed with built-in Take Profit (TP) and Stop Loss (SL) orders. This ensures that every position has pre-determined exit strategies, meticulously managing risk and protecting capital from unexpected market shifts. Seamless API Integration with Alpaca: The entire system is brought to life through its integration with the Alpaca API. This powerful, commission-free brokerage API provides the necessary infrastructure for real-time data feeds and automated order execution, allowing the AI to interact directly with the market. Key Skills \u0026amp; Technologies Demonstrated #\rThis project has been an invaluable learning experience, allowing me to apply and strengthen a diverse set of skills:\nArtificial Intelligence \u0026amp; Machine Learning: Designing, training, and deploying models for classification and regression in a real-time environment. Data Engineering: Handling, normalizing, and processing high-frequency financial time-series data. API Integration: Developing robust and efficient connections with external financial APIs for data and trading operations. Algorithmic Design: Crafting complex logic for trade entry, exit, and dynamic risk management. Software Development: Building a robust, modular, and scalable application from the ground up. Quantitative Analysis: Understanding and implementing various financial indicators and statistical methods. Risk Management: Incorporating systematic approaches to mitigate potential losses. Independent Project Management: Taking a concept from ideation through to a working prototype. What This Project Represents #\rBeyond the technical specifics, this algorithmic trading AI project underscores my commitment to problem-solving, innovation, and continuous learning. It showcases my ability to:\nTranslate complex requirements into functional code. Design and implement intelligent systems that learn from data. Integrate diverse technologies to create a cohesive solution. Approach challenges with an analytical and results-oriented mindset. I\u0026rsquo;m incredibly excited about the possibilities that AI and automation unlock across various industries. This project is a testament to my dedication to pushing the boundaries of what\u0026rsquo;s possible, and I\u0026rsquo;m eager to apply these skills to new and challenging opportunities.\n","date":"22 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/1747873251854-stock-ai/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Algorithmic Trading System with AI using Alpaca API","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"22 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/finance/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Finance","type":"tags"},{"content":"I am a bioinformatics scientist, software developer, and data scientist passionate about leveraging AI and advanced computing to create innovative solutions across bioinformatics and finance domains.\n","date":"22 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Jason Dai","summary":"","title":"Jason Dai","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"22 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/project/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Project","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Projects","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"22 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rGithub: Jasondai9 LinkedIn: jasondai9 Email: jasondai9@gmail.com\n","date":"20 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/contact/","section":"Jason Dai","summary":"","title":"Contact","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
